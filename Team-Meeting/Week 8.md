#### Meeting Minutes:

1. **Integration of Subsystem Component Diagrams**
    - The team worked collaboratively to integrate individual component diagrams from each subsystem into the overall architectural design.
    - Adjustments were made to ensure seamless communication between subsystems, especially in areas requiring frequent data exchange such as course management and user authentication.
    - Special attention was given to standardizing the design of interfaces to maintain consistency across subsystems.

2. **Finalizing Inter-Subsystem Interfaces**
    - Team members reviewed the proposed inter-subsystem communication protocols:
        - **ClaClo-Student** and **ClaClo-Teacher**: Finalized components for assignment submission and feedback exchange.
        - **ClaClo-Manager** and **ClaClo-Admin**: Discussed notification and scheduling-related interactions.
        - All subsystems aligned with **ClaClo-Cloud** for data synchronization and centralized services.
    - Minor adjustments were suggested to refine data flow and improve scalability of the system.

3. **Review and Revision of Unified System Design**
    - After integrating all subsystems, the team identified areas for improvement:
        - Enhanced modularity to allow independent updates of subsystems without affecting the whole system.
        - Inclusion of detailed documentation for all inter-component dependencies and communication mechanisms.
    - The unified system design now reflects a balanced distribution of functionalities across subsystems, reducing redundancies and improving maintainability.

#### Actions for Next Meeting:
- **Prepare visual diagrams** for presenting the finalized architectural design.
- **Review** the entire system architecture and ensure compliance with initial project requirements.
