3. Planning for Team Architectural Diagram Integration

#### Meeting Minutes:

1. **Presentation and Discussion of Subsystem Component Diagrams**  
   Each member presented their subsystem's component diagram:
    - **Leon Li** demonstrated the **Admin subsystem** architecture, focusing on user and course management components and their interactions.
    - **Silvio Zheng** outlined the **Teacher subsystem** architecture, including components for assignment management and feedback.
    - **Shawn Cui** presented the **Manager subsystem** architecture, highlighting course management, scheduling, and notifications.
    - **Yunxiang Wang** showed the **Student subsystem** architecture, detailing components for enrollment, submissions, and accessing learning materials.

2. **Feedback on Individual Component Designs**
    - The team provided feedback to ensure that each component aligns with the overall system requirements and uses consistent interface standards.
    - Suggestions included refining some component interfaces to better facilitate inter-subsystem communication.
    - Minor adjustments were recommended to enhance modularity and future integration with other subsystems.

3. **Planning for Team Architectural Diagram Integration**
    - The team agreed to start working on the overall system architectural design, integrating each subsystem’s component diagram into a unified structure.
    - Next week’s meeting will focus on combining these diagrams, finalizing inter-component communication protocols, and preparing the full team architectural diagram.

#### Actions for Next Meeting:
- **Refine** individual component diagrams based on feedback.
- **Prepare drafts** for subsystem interfaces to facilitate smooth integration.
- **Work collaboratively** on the team architectural diagram, focusing on component connections and system coherence.
