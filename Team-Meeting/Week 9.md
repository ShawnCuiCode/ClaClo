### **Meeting Minutes**

#### **1. Redesign of Subsystem Architectural and Structural Models**
- Subsystem architectures and structural models were revisited and redesigned for better clarity and modularity.
- Key focus areas included improving microservice communication, optimizing data flow, and reducing redundancies.
- **ClaClo-Manager Subsystem**: Revised component interactions to enhance curriculum management and improve scalability.

#### **2. Behavioral Model Development for Subsystems**
- Each subsystem's key workflows were documented in activity and sequence diagrams:
    - **ClaClo-Manager**: Completed models for processes like updating study plans and academic performance.
    - Other subsystems: Finalized workflows for their core functionalities, ensuring consistent user experience and interaction flow.
- Discussed edge case handling, including validation errors and system fault scenarios.

#### **3. Alignment of Individual Subsystems with Team Architectural Design**
- Subsystem models were reviewed for compliance with the unified system architecture:
    - Adjustments were made to standardize inter-subsystem communication protocols.
    - Unified data synchronization mechanisms with the ClaClo-Cloud service.

### **Actions for Next Meeting**
1. Refine behavioral models based on team feedback and prepare for final presentation.
2. Validate subsystem integration into the unified architecture.
3. Develop a draft report summarizing architectural and modeling improvements.
