Meeting Minutes:

1.	Confirm the Use of GitHub as the Project Repository
The team agreed to use GitHub as the central repository for version control and document management. A GitHub repository was set up, and all team members successfully joined the repository. Shawn Cui, as the team leader, was assigned the responsibility of overseeing the initial repository configuration.
2.	Discuss Initial Subsystem Assignments
The team reviewed the coursework document and identified the key subsystems. Each member expressed their interest in specific subsystems, and it was agreed that the final assignment of subsystems would be completed in the next meeting after further review.
3.	Outline the GitHub Collaboration Workflow
The team established a basic workflow for collaborating on GitHub, including guidelines for creating branches, submitting pull requests, and reviewing code. It was decided to create separate branches for each subsystem and use the main branch for the integrated project.
4.	Plan for Upcoming Tasks
The team decided that each member would review the subsystem requirements and propose a specific subsystem assignment in the next meeting. Additionally, the team planned to set up an initial folder structure within the GitHub repository to organize the project documents.

Actions for Next Meeting:

	•	Review subsystem requirements and propose a preferred subsystem assignment.
	•	Finalize the assignment of subsystems to each team member.
	•	Implement the initial folder structure in the GitHub repository.
